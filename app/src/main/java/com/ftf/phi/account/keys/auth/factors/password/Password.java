/* Password is an authentication method that users are most comfortable with for logging in
 *	type - What you know
 * 	explanation -
 * 		To check if a user know a password you need to have the password saved somewhere.
 * 		This becomes problematic when you have a system where anyone can do the checking themselves
 * 		instead of just a secure server.
 *
 * 		To solve that problem Password Based Key Derivation Functions(PBKDF) where invented
 *
 * 		What a pbkdf does is hash the password in a way which allows multiple iterations of the hash.
 * 		A hash is a function that is easy to compute one way but real hard to compute the otherway.
 * 		This means if I can pass 6 into the function and get a 9 out but I can't start with a 9 and
 * 		get a 6 out. The only way I could find out that 6 -> 9 is by trying 1 -> ?, 2 -> ?, etc...
 *
 * 		Most people use a password that is about 8-10 characters a-Z 0-9 and special characters.
 * 		This means there are about 72^10 or 3.743906243Ã—10^18 possible passwords in that range.
 * 		We can agree that only about 0.0001% of those are passwords that are actually going to be used
 * 		because while sT3&6G1^a is a nice password most people wont use it because they won't remember
 * 		it. This means we have more around 3743906243 passwords possible if we are being optimistic
 * 		If a computer can run the password hash 1 time every ms then it would only take 43.3 days to
 * 		crack a users password. Those kinds of speeds might be what you get on your grandmas computer
 * 		from the 1980's but even my $200 walmart laptop can pull 200h/s. On dedicated hardware
 * 		designed to crack passwords you could have the password before your finger even left the start
 * 		key.
 *
 * 		This is where hashing algorithm's designed to be a pbkdf come in. If we chain together hashes
 * 		then instead of 1 hash being 1 password we can make it so that 10,000 hashes are one password.
 * 		This has the effect of taking exponentially longer to crack a password the more iterations we
 * 		add.
 *
 * 		The last part of the pbkdf to explain is salt. Salt is just a random value that gets added to
 * 		the end of the password. This is because there will still be the 100 most common passwords.
 * 		Every password put through will always have the same output. This means if someone used
 * 		"password" as there password it would always be the same thing. Then if you where to crack one
 * 		person using password you would crack them all. With salt there password is no longer
 * 		"password" but now its "password1ab93". The user dose'nt even need to know salt exist but it
 * 		can still be protecting them.
 *
 * 		Even with pbkdf users can still pick stupid passwords. This means that the 1000 most common
 * 		passwords must be banned. This makes it harder to crack passwords. If you are making a
 * 		password cracker you aren't going to try "aaaaaaa", "aaaaaab", "aaaaaac", etc... you will
 * 		first try "password", "qwerty", etc... If the first 1000 passwords are banned then users will
 * 		more often pick a password that isn't easy to crack.
